# WeTransfer Clone

## Project Overview

WeTransfer Clone is a web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of WeTransfer, a popular file transfer service. This project focuses on providing a user-friendly interface where users can easily upload files, input recipient information, and manage their transfers. The design is responsive and visually appealing, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   Simply double-click on the `index.html` file, or use a local server setup to view the application.

## Usage

Once you have the application loaded in your browser:

1. You can add files by clicking on the "Add files" button.
2. Enter the email addresses of the recipients, your own email, a title for the transfer, and an optional message.
